# apps

Publicly available App exports to be imported in your pointflow server.
As this repository is public, make sure that no private credentials or sensible information is present in your Apps.

The folders that contain the Apps are the following:
* frontYard: Everything is the front yard is available to the world to see and goes on the demoflow03 server instance
* livingRoom: Put here Apps that you are ready to show to your friends but that would make you blush if shared publicly
* toolShed: Put there Apps that are used to debug you other Appsa

* basement: This is for all your Apps that are on ongoing development, and somewhere to back them up 
* kitchen: For all Apps that are experiments, perfect r\folder if your App will not work on current servers for a lack of the right asset
* theCorner: App that used to work but are now broken go in the corner until they are ready to behave

The server version used to develop the apps in the frontYard, livingRoom and toolShed must be specified in this readme, to be sure they can still run on the latest server releease.
