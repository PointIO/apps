Work queue tasks are listed on the side so everyone knows exactly what to do next.  Tasks can be generated by any app, even if it is not in the user's App Box.  For example, in the Expense Report App, a field engineer's expense authorization may be sent to a manager's task queue even though he doesn't use that app to generate his own expenses. With our task oriented approach and patent pending Universal To-Do Task List, we break down legacy systems into mobile apps that drive real productivity. Compose your app once and deploy it anywhere, even from your desktop.  With Point.io, workflow solutions for your phone are now quick, easy and affordable.
